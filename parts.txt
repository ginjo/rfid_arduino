ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS

Arduino Nano or Pro Mini with angle headers on the "digital" side
and nothing on the other sides, except where absolutely necessary
(like VIN/VCC).

WL-125 RFID reader (or other supported modules)
  with angle headers
  1000 uf capacitor (if it comes with WL-125)
  antenna
  
Mosfet N-channel for reader power control

4.7k resistor pull-down for reader power mosfet

Bluetooth serial module (HC-06, HC-05, HM-10, BT-12, BT-05)

5v power supply module with angle headers,
or LM7805 or LM2937 with .1uf and 10uf capacitors.

7812 12v regulator (only for dash dimmer sensor) Really? Would that work?

3K/2K or 3.3k/2.2k (or the equivalent x 10) resistors to form 3.3v voltage divider
  for Arduino TX output to BT RX pin.
  
Piezo speaker (sans beeper circuitry)

NPN transistor to drive beeper

Resistors for beeper
  ...
  
Capacitors for beeper
  ...
  
RGB LED

Resistors for LED
  20k for blue leg
  47k for green leg
  none for red leg (still protected by 220ohm from transistor-to-ground).
  220ohm for NPN emitter-to-ground

NPN transistor for LED dimmer
  10K pot (Check current build)
  10k for pot supply (Check current build)
  10k for wiper-to-npn-base(Check current build)

Button for failsafe/debug mode

Button for reset, maybe?

SSR output relay (~5v => ~12v)
